# ChangeExtensionPlugin

This plugin helps changing extensions of assets and scripts 
in order to use **HtmlWebpackPlugin** (<https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin>)
and **CompressionWebpackPlugin** (<https://github.com/webpack-contrib/compression-webpack-plugin>) together.

**Installation**

*with yarn* `yarn add change-extension-plugin lodash`

*with npm*  `npm install change-extension-plugin lodash --save-dev`

**Include in your project**

`const ChangeExtensionPlugin = require('change-extension-plugin');`

**Use like this**
```
plugins: [
  new CompressionPlugin(
      {
        algorithm: 'gzip',
        threshold: 10240,
        deleteOriginalAssets: true,
      }
    ),
    new HTMLWebpackPlugin(
      {
        template: './public/index.html',
        filename: './views/index.html',
      }
    ),
    new ChangeExtensionPlugin(
      {
        /**
         * These are the extensions of files that
         * will be changed after html is processed.
         */
        extensions: ['js', 'css'],
        /**
         * Extension of the compression method.
         * 'gz' by default
         */
        compressionMethod: 'gz',
      }
    ),
]
```

*That's all!*
